About a decade ago, somewhere between the rise of jQuery and the fall of Flash, vBulletin 4.x was king. It powered countless online communities, from gaming clans to enterprise tech support boards. And like many kings of old, it had its share of dark secrets. In this blog post, we’ll be digging into a pretty esoteric PHP Object Injection vulnerability I recently spotted on certain vBulletin 4.x versions...

                        vBulletin is one of the most widely used commercial forum solutions on the internet, powering thousands of online communities ranging from niche hobbyist sites to large-scale tech forums.

Over the years, vBulletin has gained a reputation for both its ubiquity and its vulnerability surface — often becoming a prime target for web application exploits.
